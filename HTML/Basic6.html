        <h1>Example of Image Tag</h1>
        <img src="https://imgcdn.stablediffusionweb.com/2024/11/6/79bed6da-b062-4388-b774-c53430034a29.jpg" 
            height="300" width="300"
            alt="Computer Geek Image"
        />
        <!--img tag is for add the image, src tag is used for providing the link of the image source-->
        <!--image src could be offline as well as online, in case of offline follow the working directory path with respect to the image
               storage path -->
        <!--in case of online, copy the image link address-->
        <!--IN CSS we will be handling the height and width but in html tag also we can set heigh and width using attributes-->

        <!--alt attribute is used,in case the image doesnot open due to source or link problem, the the viewers can see the alt text
            in place of the image
        -->
            

        <!--Concept of Absolute Path and Relative Path-->

        <!-- Realtive Paths

            ./abc.jpg     -> image file in the folder , same as html file
            ./XY/abc.jpg  -> image file in the folder XY, XY folder same as the html file

            ../   -> Go to the parent folder of the html file   
            ../../  -> Go to the parent then again to the parent folder
        -->

        <!-- Absolute Paths
        
        Start from the root directory
        like C drive 
        
        C:/users/folderX/folderY/abc.png
        
        -->

        <!--But we should not give the access to the root folder of the server-->
